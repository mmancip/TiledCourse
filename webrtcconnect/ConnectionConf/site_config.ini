# GPU_FILE: file where a list of host machine / GPU number is available, to be
#     used by the various docker instances
# HTTP_FRONTEND : the http machine like "myfrontend.org". Frontend can't be localhost because inside containers, the ssh tunneling wont work.
# HTTP_IP : HTTP IP to connect ssh tunneling from containers. This can be the supercomputer frontend
